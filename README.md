# historicalsyntaxgrammaticalisation
Grammaticalisation is a major type of historical change which is minimally defined as the creation of (more) functional elements. There are different types of grammaticalisation, one of which is 'lateral' grammaticalisation which differs from mainstream types of grammaticalisation in not having weakening effects on the resultant functional elements. Adopting a formal Minimalist approach, these empirical differences and the different types of functional elements created can be accounted for by considering the differential frequency and weakening effects of the grammaticalising elements.
